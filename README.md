#Discription:
This was intended to be a part of a random youtube playlist generator, using randomly generated potential youtube IDs.  It is currently not working.
#What is the problem?
Unfortunatly a 11 character string with 64 potential characters in each space means that there are quite alot of potential ids, some of which are no
longer available, (due to one reason or another).  That means most of the ids generated, from a glance, are duds.  
#Moving foward status:
That means this project has been moved to lower priority so I can concentrate on other things.
